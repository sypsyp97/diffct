diffct: Differentiable Computed Tomography Operators
====================================================

A high-performance, CUDA-accelerated library for circular orbit CT reconstruction with end-to-end differentiable operators, enabling advanced optimization and deep learning integration in medical imaging and scientific computing.

**Key Features**
----------------
- **High Performance:** CUDA-accelerated projection and backprojection operations with optimized memory management
- **Fully Differentiable:** End-to-end gradient propagation through all CT operations for seamless deep learning integration
- **Modular API:** Clear separation of projector operators, geometry builders, and utility helpers
- **Multiple Geometries:** Support for 2D parallel-beam, 2D fan-beam, and 3D cone-beam geometries
- **PyTorch Integration:** Native PyTorch autograd support with custom CUDA kernels
- **Research Ready:** Optimized for both analytical reconstruction (FBP/FDK) and iterative methods

**Supported Geometries**
------------------------
- **Parallel Beam (2D):** Traditional parallel-beam geometry for 2D CT reconstruction
- **Fan Beam (2D):** Fan-beam geometry with configurable source-detector distances
- **Cone Beam (3D):** Full 3D cone-beam geometry for volumetric reconstruction

**Applications**
----------------
- Medical image reconstruction with deep learning enhancement
- Physics-informed neural networks for CT imaging
- Iterative reconstruction algorithms with learned priors
- Multi-modal imaging research and development
- Educational CT reconstruction demonstrations
