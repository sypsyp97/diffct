Examples
========

This section contains practical examples demonstrating how to use **diffct** for various tomographic reconstruction tasks.

The examples are organized into two main categories:

- **FBP (Filtered Back Projection)**: Classical analytical reconstruction methods
- **Iterative Methods**: Gradient-based iterative reconstruction algorithms
